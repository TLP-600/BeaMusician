# BeaMusician
In this Repository, you will learn about the most important musicians of all the times and inspire with the most popular.
My favourite musicians are, Matthias Jabs, Rudolf Schenker, Uli Jon Roth and Jimy Hendrix, they are very popular and important guitarists of all the time, and the best form to be a very good guitarist, you have to practice always, the best form to have the thing that you want to do, practice is the best way.
